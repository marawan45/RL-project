Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning for FrozenLake
This repository contains implementations of Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agents for solving the FrozenLake-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The goal is to navigate a 4x4 grid, avoiding holes and reaching the goal.

Q-Learning: The agent learns the optimal policy by updating a Q-table based on state-action-reward-state transitions.

Deep Q-Learning: The agent uses a neural network to approximate the Q-values for state-action pairs.
